            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded with a passion for adventure and the outdoors, our company began offering white-water rafting
                trips to share the
                beauty and excitement of the river. Over the years, we’ve grown from a small local outfitter into a
                trusted name in
                outdoor recreation. Our team has guided countless guests through safe and memorable experiences,
                building lasting
                connections along the way. Today, we continue to uphold our commitment to adventure, safety, and a love
                for the great
                outdoors.</p>
