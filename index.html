        <p>Utah, nicknamed the Beehive State, became the 45th U.S. state in 1896. It’s famous for its five national
            parks (the
            “Mighty 5”), the Great Salt Lake, and being the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints in Salt
            Lake City. Utah hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics, has the youngest population in the U.S., and is home to
            unique red rock
            landscapes like Arches and Zion. </p>
